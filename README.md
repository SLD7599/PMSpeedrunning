# Paper Mario Speedrunning Website
http://sld7599.github.io/PMSpeedrunning/

The website only has one page, all the links are empty. This was only made as an example to see how a dedicated website and leaderboard would work for Paper Mario speedrunning. Most runners preferred to use [speedrun.com](http://www.speedrun.com/pmario/), so I just dropped the project.
